I am a software engineer in the vehicle dynamics department of [Williams Racing](https://www.williamsf1.com/), building simulation tools to support car development. Previous to this, I worked at [Red Bull Racing](https://www.redbullracing.com).

I have a degree in Computer Science from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) and in Automotive Engineering from the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/), where I was a member of [Team Bath Racing](https://www.teambathracing.com/). I relish any oportunity to solve an interesting problem, but also have a keen interest in deloployment, build infrastructure and delivering quality tools that make a difference.

In my spare time I can usually be found playing with my kids, drinking cocktails with my wife, baking or if I'm very lucky, motor racing with my [dad](https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/corse-clienti/drivers/graham-de-zille).
